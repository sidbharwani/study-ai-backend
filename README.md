# Study AI - Backend
This repository contains the **backend** for my personal summer project, **Study AI**, built to make studying faster, responsive, and more effective. This backend contains a **serverless API** hosted on **Cloudfare Workers** that securely connects the frontend to the **OpenAI API**.

The backend handles: 
* AI-powered **flashcard** generation
* **Practice tests** with customizable difficulty
* Effective **study guides** created automatically through AI
* **Step-by-step solutions** for problem solving

  ## Features
  * Accepts **POST** requests with user prompts + optional chat history
  * Calls **OpenAI API** with a secure server-side key (never exposed to frontend users)
  * Supports multiple study modes mentioned above and has preset keys for easy access

---
## Tech Stack
* **Cloudfare Workers** (Serverless deployment)
* **JavaScript**
* **OpenAI API**
* **Wrangler CLI** for local development & deployment

## Installation & Setup 

**1. Clone the Repository** 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidbharwani/study-ai-backend.git
cd study-ai-backend
```

**2. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Configure Wrangler**
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

**4. Set Environment Variables**
```bash
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
````

**5. Local Deployment**
```bash
npm run dev
```
Local URL: http://127.0.0.1:8787

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8787/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Topic: Physics\nLevel: basic\nCount: 5","history":[]}'
```

**6. Deployment**
Deploy to Cloudfare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

You will get a URL like:
```bash
https://study-ai-backend.<your-cloudfare-subdomain>.workers.dev
```

Therefore, update your frontend to use: 
```bash
const BACKEND_URL = "https://study-ai-backend.<your-cloudfare-subdomain>.workers.dev"
```

## Why I Built This? 
Most study platforms (Quizlet, Kahoot, Chegg), even though use AI to make  preparation of guides, flashcards, and tests easier and faster, I wanted to make an AI chat-centric interface so that without learning the platform, one can automatically shoot a text to AI and instruct it to do the following features mentioned above. 

With **Study AI**, you can type your topic, and AI isntantly creates ready-to-use study content. 

This backend powers that experience - securely, reliably, and at scale.
